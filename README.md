# Design Kata: Automated Sensor Updates
This is a simple project intended as a practice design kata

## Problem:
You are part of an IoT company shipping sensors to a vast amount of clients. These sensors, which are of type TS50X, 
have a firmware from their original manufacturer, which is pretty trustworthy. In your company these sensors have to be  
configured so that they send valuable information which is of interest to the vast amount of clients.

While testing the sensors with the latest configuration, people noticed a compatibility problem with older firmware. There 
are new features which can be configured, but some older firmware doesn't know how to deal with those new features. 
So the sensors only do a part of what they should be doing. We canâ€™t have that, our company stands for high quality and 
happy customers. So we need to prepare these sensors before shipping. 

What we need is a web service which, given a list of sensor ids, will check if the firmware version is recent enough. It 
schedules an update if it is not recent enough. When all of that checks out, schedule a configuration update. The result
of the request should be an overview of the current state of the sensors. Are they ready to be shipped? If not, then what
needs to be done?

## Some notes on the solution on this branch

This solution is not the one I would have gone for. It is pretty close, but it has more interfaces than I would 
normally use. Also, the decision to put everything in a folder named after the use case (`statuscheck`) would be something
I wouldn't have done yet. There is only one use case in this code base, so there is no need yet to separate between 
different use cases. 

If a different use case would all of sudden need to be implemented, it is up to the developer to do the separation of 
use cases at that time.
